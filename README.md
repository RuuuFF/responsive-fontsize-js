# ‚öôÔ∏è Project

I created this project, using **JavaScript**, to solve a need of mine, to adjust the font size depending on the size of the user's viewport, in a **more responsive** and **intuitive** way than mediaqueries, from CSS.

# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to use?

In the <a href="#">Fonts.js</a> folder have an object called **_Options_** and an array called **_Fonts_**.

Starting with **_Options_**:

```js
const Options = {
  minWidth: 420,
  maxWidth: 1365,
  measure: "rem",
};
```

In the object **_Options_**, i'm passing the minimum (minWidth) amount and the maximum (maxWidth) of the viewport, so that it scales the font size while between these two values, with them, the measure that I will use (important for the next part).

Now in the array **_Fonts_**:

```js
const Fonts = [
  {
    selector: "h1",
    minFontsize: 2.2,
    maxFontsize: 3,
    minLineheight: 2.8,
    maxLineheight: 3.6,
  },

  {
    selector: "p",
    minFontsize: 1.6,
    maxFontsize: 2.4,
    minLineheight: 2.2,
    maxLineheight: 3,
  },
];
```

In the array **_Fonts_** i add objects, inside each object I pass the _selector_, the minimum and maximum font size and line height value (_minFontsize_, _maxFontsize_, _minLineheight_, _maxLineheight_) I want.

So, while the screen is between _420px_ e _1365px_, font-size of element **p** will scale from 1.6rem (16px) to 2.4rem (24px). Being the same with **h1** and yours line height values.
